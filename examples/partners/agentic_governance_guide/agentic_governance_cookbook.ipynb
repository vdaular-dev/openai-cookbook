    "# Building Governed AI Agents: A Practical Guide to Agentic Scaffolding\n",

    "**A cookbook for enabling safe, scalable AI agent adoption in your organization**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Shift in Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Every enterprise faces the same tension: the pressure to adopt AI is immense, but so is the fear of getting it wrong. Teams want to build, legal wants to review, security wants to audit, and promising pilots stall because no one can answer: *\"Is this safe to deploy?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations have moved past *\"Should we experiment with AI?\"* and now ask *\"How do we get this into production safely?\"* The prototypes worked, the demos impressed the board, and now there's real pressure to deliver AI that touches real customers and handles real data. But production demands answers that pilots never required: What happens when it fails? Who's accountable? How do we prove it's compliant?\n",
    "\n",
    "The organizations winning at AI have discovered something counterintuitive: **governance drives delivery.** When guardrails are clear and automated, teams build with confidence. When policies travel with the code, security reviews become approvals instead of interrogations. When compliance is infrastructure rather than inspection, pilots graduate to production in weeks, not quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to build the scaffolding that lets you move fast *because* you're safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Cookbook Delivers\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows you how to make governance part of core infrastructure from day one, instead of a launch-time afterthought.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define policies as code** that version, travel, and deploy alongside your applications\n",
    "- **Apply guardrails automatically** to every AI call - no manual review bottlenecks\n",
    "- **Evaluate your defenses** with precision and recall metrics, so you know they actually work\n",
    "- **Package governance for distribution** so any team can `pip install` instant compliance\n",
    "- **Build agentic systems** with proper handoffs, observability, and oversight from day one\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section pairs a concrete governance objective with a practical implementation pattern, including example configurations, code snippets, and integration points you can adapt to your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a working blueprint for governed AI that scales across your organization and turns governance from a friction point into a competitive advantage.\n",

    "[Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo) is an open-source red teaming tool that auto-generates hundreds of adversarial inputs across 50+ vulnerability types — jailbreaks, prompt injections, PII extraction, off-topic hijacking, and more. Instead of writing test cases by hand, Promptfoo creates sophisticated, adaptive attacks and tests them against your actual application.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Governance enables adoption\n",
    "By establishing clear guardrails upfront, you remove the fear and uncertainty that slows AI adoption. Teams can build confidently knowing policies are enforced automatically. Governance becomes an execution system that keeps adoption moving securely and at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use handoffs for specialization\n",
    "Avoid one massive agent. Create specialists and let them collaborate. The `handoff_description` is key to good routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Layer your defenses\n",
    "- **OpenAI Guardrails** (client-level): Universal policies for all calls\n",
    "- **Agents SDK guardrails** (agent-level): Domain-specific validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Trace everything (or nothing, for ZDR)\n",
    "- Use `trace()` to group operations for debugging\n",
    "- For ZDR compliance: disable tracing or use custom processors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Centralize policy, distribute capability\n",
    "The policy-as-a-package pattern lets you:\n",
    "- Maintain governance in one place\n",
    "- Update policies without changing application code\n",
    "- Audit compliance across all projects\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Setup\n",
    "1. **Create your policy repo** using the template above\n",
    "2. **Customize guardrails** for your industry and compliance requirements\n",
    "3. **Add custom trace processors** if you need ZDR-compliant observability\n",
    "4. **Document your policy** alongside the code\n",
    "5. **Set up CI/CD** to test policy changes before deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling AI Across Your Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "When moving from prototype to production, consider how different user groups will interact with AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Role | What They Build | Governance Approach |\n",
    "|------|-----------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Developers** | Custom agents, MCP connectors, integrations | Safe defaults, reusable templates, evaluation pipelines |\n",
    "| **Power Users** | Configured assistants, automated workflows | Pre-approved patterns, governed portals |\n",
    "| **End Users** | Content generation, data analysis | Curated tools with embedded guardrails |\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures everyone, from engineers to analysts, can leverage AI safely within appropriate boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Citizen Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "Empower non-technical teams to build safely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provide templates** for prompt packs, tool configurations, and evaluation checks\n",
    "- **Create review lanes** and publishing workflows that make it easy to build and deploy\n",
    "- **Offer guardrailed sandboxes** for experimentation without risking sensitive data\n",
    "- **Establish clear promotion paths** from prototype to production with governance checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Registries for Visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Treat AI assets as first-class governed resources by maintaining registries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Registry**: Register all agents with owner, purpose, risk tier, and evaluation status\n",
    "- **Tool Registry**: Document MCP tools with authentication scopes, data access, and approval authority\n",
    "- **Prompt Registry**: Version and govern prompts like code, with lineage, rollback policies, and change controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Registry metadata enables discoverability, auditing, and lifecycle management across your AI ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk-Proportionate Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all AI use cases carry the same risk. Differentiate your controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-risk** (internal productivity, non-sensitive data): Fast-track approval, minimal logging\n",
    "- **Moderate-risk** (customer-facing, operational data): Standard guardrails, audit trails\n",
    "- **High-risk** (PII, financial, regulated): Enhanced logging, human-in-the-loop, isolated environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply proportionate controls, approvals, review, and detailed logging, only where necessary, keeping lightweight adoption fast and frictionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing Shadow AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized governance helps prevent unauthorized AI tools from proliferating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Make governed options easier** than ungoverned alternatives\n",
    "- **Provide clear adoption paths** for different skill levels and use cases\n",
    "- **Incorporate discovery mechanisms** to detect and catalog unsanctioned AI activity\n",
    "- **Offer support and training** so teams don't go around the system\n",
    "\n",
    "Early visibility allows governance teams to close gaps before they become systemic risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standards Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Align your governance practices with recognized frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NIST AI RMF** - Risk management framework for AI systems\n",
    "- **ISO/IEC 42001** - AI management system standard\n",
    "- **Industry-specific requirements** (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, etc.)\n",
